# BIG IoT Documentation and Example Code

This repository includes documentation and example code for using the BIG IoT Marketplace and SDK.


## Why use BIG IoT?

1. The [BIG IoT Marketplace](https://market.big-iot.org/) gives you:
   * **access to many relevant [data sources]()**
   * **allows you to monetize your data/results** (i.e. this could be part of your business model for your solution)
2. The BIG IoT SDKs allow you to offer or consume data from other stakeholder **with a few lines of code** (see examples below).

**Related technologies:**
- Any data from IoT devicde connected to Bosch IoT Things can be directly offered on the BIG IoT Marketplace using the [Bosch Things-Marketplace Connector service]().
- [FlowHub]() provides a ready to use building block to offer data from IoT devices (including those connected to the Bosch IoT Hub) on the Marketplace.


## BIG IoT Marketplace 

- **Public BIG IoT Marketplace: [https://market.big-iot.org/](https://market.big-iot.org/)**
- **BCX Marketplace: [https://to-be-defined/]()**


## Developer Guide 

- **Java Example project for [download](https://github.com/BIG-IoT/example-projects):** This includes both, a BIG IoT Data Provider and Data Consumer project in Java, including all build files to build and run it direclty (`gradle run`) or import it into your IDE.

### How to develop a BIG IoT Consumer?

- **[Java Example Consumer](https://github.com/BIG-IoT/example-projects/tree/master/java-example-consumer):** This is part of the example project above. 
- Detailed [Java developer tutorial for a Consumer](https://big-iot.github.io/provPerspective/) application

### How to develop a BIG IoT Provider?

- **[Java Example Provider](https://github.com/BIG-IoT/example-projects/tree/master/java-example-provider):** This is part of the example project above. 
- Detailed [Java developer tutorial for a Provider](https://big-iot.github.io/consumerPerspective/) application

Further Java example applications for consumers and providers are available [here](https://github.com/BIG-IoT/example-projects/tree/master/more-java-examples/src/main/java/org/eclipse/bigiot/lib/examples).
